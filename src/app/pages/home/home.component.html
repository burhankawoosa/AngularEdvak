                Medical practice management software aids in the administration of day-to-day operations in a medical office. It acts as an intermediary between some forms of clinical activity, such as the reporting of diagnostic and treatment codes, and other types of work, including as arranging patient visits, validating insurance, and handling medical billing responsibilities.
