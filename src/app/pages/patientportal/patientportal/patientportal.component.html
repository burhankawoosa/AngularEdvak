        Edvak patient portals provide a means by which patients can access their health information, including diagnostic test results. Using Edvak patient portal, patients get encrypted and password-protected login access to a personal profile using which they can make appointments (non-urgent), transfer health history, diagnoses, allergies, and chronic conditions, view lab results, discharge summaries, view request referrals, refill prescriptions, check benefits, update insurance or contact information, make payments to the provider’s office, complete forms, ask questions through secure e-mail and so on. If a patient has a child under age 18 years, they may be given access to their child’s patient portal, too. Providers can also get in touch with a patient through the portal. They will also receive reminders and alerts.

        With Edvak patient portal: 
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The patient can access their secure personal health information and be in touch with the provider’s office 24 hours a day. They do not need to wait for office hours or returned phone calls to have basic issues resolved. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Patients can access all of their personal health information from all of their providers in one place. If they have a team of providers, or see specialists regularly, they can all post results and reminders in a portal. Providers can see what other treatments and advice the patient is getting. This can lead to better care and better management of patients’ medicines. 
        </li>
        <li>
            E-mail reminders and alerts help a patient remember things like annual checkups and flu shots.
